Back in 2007, I happened to stumble upon a game called Roblox. This game introduced me to game development and my first programming language Lua; these tools allowed me to create several games for the first time. After coding a robot to move using MATLAB in one of my first-year college classes, I knew for sure that being a programmer was my dream job.

Fast forward to a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and minor in Computer Science at San Jose State University, I am now a software engineer and web developer with 3+ years of professional experience. I honed my craft in front-end development at various companies such as Fidelity Investments and PayPal, utilizing front-end languages and frameworks such as TypeScript, React, and Angular to build exceptional, intuitive, and accessible web experiences. 

When I'm not coding, I love to play video games of all sorts and genres and enjoy staying active through various fitness activities and sports such as weightlifting, hiking, and rock climbing!
